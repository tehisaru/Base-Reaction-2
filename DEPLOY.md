# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This project is now configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Quick Setup

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on **Settings** tab
   - Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
   - The deployment will start automatically

## How it works

- The project will automatically build and deploy when you push to the `main` branch
- The build process creates optimized static files
- Your game will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/base-reaction-2`

## Manual Deployment

You can also trigger deployment manually:
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" 
- Click "Run workflow"

## Features Ready

✅ Explosion particles now use player colors with variations instead of gray
✅ Automated GitHub Pages deployment workflow
✅ Optimized build process for static hosting
✅ Proper asset handling for web deployment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Make sure your repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
3. Verify the repository name matches the expected URL structure

Your game is now ready to be published on GitHub Pages with one push!
